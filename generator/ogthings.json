Conquering a mountain can be quite a challenge, especially for unprepared players, due to the several dangers, including deep patches of powder snow, the ramming goats, and of course, its steep and towering heights. However, not all mountains are generated equally as it can sometimes just be a big meadow hill or a short mountain peak, so it's best to find one with very tall terrain and a \"peak\" biome. \nThere are many reasons for conquering a mountain. Perhaps you want to harvest its massive reserves of snow (Snowy slopes, jagged and frozen peaks only), stone, calcite (Stony peaks only), spruce wood (Groves only), iron, coal, or even emerald ore or build something cool on top, or try to find a deep dark underground for an ancient city, or maybe you simply want to do it for the fun or challenge.",

It's a farm to build to glitchlessly renewably farm items like sand, red sand and small dripleaf. However, in a normal minecraft world, all those things are easy to get, so it isn't the most practical farm.  Additionally, it will require several emeralds, so you might need to have a villager trading hall or raid farm. This farm is generally only useful for single biomes or other types of survival challenges, where some resources are limited (for example a ice only world where you can't get red sand).",

Honey bottles are food items that are able to cure poison, and can also be used for crafting sugar and honey blocks, the latter of which have sticky properties that give them a variety of useful applications. \nHoney is generated by bees after they collect pollen and nectar.  Bees emerge from their home and go looking for flowers. After collecting pollen and nectar at the flowers, the bees return home and go inside to turn the nectar into honey. When done, the bees emerge again to look for more flowers. Over time the honey collects until the bee nest or beehive is full and can then be harvested by the player in various forms.",

Like other Telltale Games, decisions that the player makes have an impact on story elements in future episodes. However, unlike Telltale's previous games that carry more mature or emotional overtones including the death of major characters, Story Mode is known as a family-friendly title, so the decisions are still pivotal and emotional but do not involve mature imagery or themes. Elements of crafting and building, central to Minecraft, are included in the gameplay, following a similar approach. The game features combat and other action sequences, carried out through both quick time events similar to Telltale's other episodic games, and more arcade-like controls, such as steering around debris on a road. The game also mixes new characters with original themes to make an entirely original Minecraft experience.",

If you want to make Minecraft portable for an older launcher version, please view this page instead. \nThis tutorial explains how to run Minecraft on a portable location (e.g. on a thumb drive). Portable installation is, an installation that is not \"integrated\" with the computer, which is useful for managing multiple installations and generally keeping things organised. This is useful if you want to retain your game data (launcher profiles, worlds, resource packs, etc.) when switching computers. \nIf you are not planning to play Minecraft on a thumb drive but on your main hard drive instead, it's highly recommended for you to make the game portable with this guide because this will give you some big advantages over standard installation. If you store different Minecraft versions (1.8, 1.12, modded 1.12, modded 1.7.10, latest, etc.) in one folder/launcher instance, mods/worlds/settings from other versions may conflict with version you are currently playing. If you want to separate them on standard installation, you will have to also keep each folder of each version in .minecraft directory and rename them every time you want to change version you are currently playing. On portable installation only a folder and launcher script file is needed to be created and after following this guide you can just play selected version just by double-clicking on its script file. \nNote: After this guide the game will be only 99% portable: the game data will be stored and used by game and its launcher where you want but launcher will create .minecraft directory anyway and will be placing there (just only) its log files (like update logs, logs with game messages and crashes, etc.) If you really care about it, you can combine this guide with the guide for the old launcher: the game will create .minecraft directory if it doesn't exist anyway but will just leave it empty[unverified].",
